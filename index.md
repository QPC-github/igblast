IgBLAST was developed at the NCBI to facilitate the analysis of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor variable domain sequences.

IgBLAST allows users to view the matches to the germline V, D and J genes, details at rearrangement junctions, the delineation of 
IG V domain framework regions and complementarity determining regions. IgBLAST has the capability to analyse nucleotide and 
protein sequences and can process sequences in batches. Furthermore, IgBLAST allows searches against the germline gene databases 
and other sequence databases simultaneously to minimize the chance of missing possibly the best matching germline V gene.

IgBLAST is described in  [(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23671333)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23671333)
